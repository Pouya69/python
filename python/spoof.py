port = 2525 
smtp_server = "smtp.mailtrap.io"
login = "pooyasalehi69@gmail.com" # paste your login generated by Mailtrap
password = "ihatefortnite" # paste your password generated by Mailtrap

# specify the sender’s and receiver’s email addresses
sender = "gay.dude@paypal.com"
receiver = "pooyasalehi69@gmail.com"

# type your message: use two newlines (\n) to separate the subject from the message body, and use 'f' to  automatically insert variables in the text
message = f"""\
Subject: Hi Mailtrap
To: {receiver}
From: {sender}

This is my first message with Python."""
